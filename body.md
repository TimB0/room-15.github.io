Welcome to Stack Overflow's Android Room rules page. We heard you like Android and rules so we put unicorns in it because unicorns.

This page is here to give you a complete list of rules specific to the Android chat room.

### How Can I Get Write Access?

<section markdown='1'>

Getting write access is easy, simply request write access once you've joined the room. When a room owner is available, they should check to see if you can join.

Keep in mind that we don't give write access to users who:

- Display obvious [help-vampire](http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/) qualities.

- Use a default username, such as user31415926. We prefer you choose a name that won't be lost among the others â€” user1234, user2341, and user3241 are hard to pick apart in discussions.

- Have neither asked nor answered reasonable questions on Stack Overflow. We expect you to have contributed somehow to Stack Overflow before joining the chat.

- Request write access repeatedly in an effort to get attention. This just annoys us.

### What Are The Rules?

<section markdown='1'>

The rules are as follows:

1. Don't ask a question here before first [thoroughly](http://stackoverflow.com/search) [researching](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/search) [it](https://www.google.com) [yourself](http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html) and posting it on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) (or another appropriate Stack Exchange site, like [programmers.se](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/)). We also expect you to read the [Android developer site](http://developer.android.com/) before asking a question about Android.

    When you share a link to an SO question, paste the link in the chat box with no other text. This allows the chat to one-box the question.

2. Use English and try to write well. This means no chat-speak (e.g., "u r vry gud i m new dev lol").

3. Don't paste blocks of code into the chat. Make a [gist] or use another pastebin if you must share code. Any code in the chatroom should be limited to one line at about 80 columns max.

4. Don't ping users (@username-ing) unless it's to clarify who you're speaking to or you need to get a specific person's attention. Pinging for help is bannable.

5. Everything unicorn-related is allowed.

6. Please don't post unprofessional images. Kitties and unicorns: okay. A screenshot of your app: sure. Twerking: no.

7. Don't flag messages you find personally offensive (e.g., swear words, blasphemy, and so on). It just annoys the people who have to respond to flags.

8. When you go to the store to buy bourbon, don't shame your honor by buying cheap, bottom-shelf stuff. That will only embarrass you.

The choice to enforce the rules is at the discretion of each room owner. The rules are purposefully difficult to break, we just ask that you not be a dick. Cheers, have fun, and be excellent to one another.
