# Android Room Rules

This repo is used to hold the the room rules page for the [Stack Overflow Android chat room][room15]. 
The page is automatically generated by `travis` on every commit and automatically pushed to the repo. 

Currently, the built rules are hosted at <http://room-15.github.io>.

## Contribute 

If you want to add changes to the room rules, then just fork the repository, make your changes in the **`body.md`** file and send in a pull request.  
Do *not* edit the `index.html` file. This file is generated by the travis bot from the content of `body.md`.

For quick reference:

- head.in — this contains the top third of the output HTML, including the inline stylesheet and such.
- tail.in — the bottom third. Just closes off the remaining tags opened by the head.
- body.md — the rules text itself. Contains the revision number at the top. Each time a new version of the rules is published, this number should be incremented. Minor fixes don't merit revision increments.
