# Android Room Rules Template

This repo is used to hold the pre-built content for the [Stack Overflow Android chat room][room15]'s rules. To build the rules, you'll need a version of Ruby and the [kramdown] gem installed. You may optionally substitute kramdown for any multimarkdown utility that's compatible with its extensions by setting and exporting the `MULTIMARKDOWN` environment variable.

Once you've got kramdown or something equivalent, run the `build` script and the index.html will be popped out.

Currently, the built rules are hosted at <http://room-15.github.io>.

For quick reference:

- head.in — this contains the top third of the output HTML, including the inline stylesheet and such.
- tail.in — the bottom third. Just closes off the remaining tags opened by the head.
- body.md — the rules text itself. Contains the revision number at the top. Each time a new version of the rules is published, this number should be incremented. Minor fixes don't merit revision increments.
